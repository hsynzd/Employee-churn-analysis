## Steps and Analysis

### 1. Introduction
The project begins with an introduction explaining the objective of the analysis. This includes a description of the dataset and the main goals.

### 2. Data Loading
The dataset is loaded and inspected to understand its structure and initial content.

### 3. Data Cleaning
This section involves handling missing values, correcting data types, and making necessary adjustments to prepare the data for analysis.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this step, various visualizations and summaries are created to explore the data and identify patterns, trends, and relationships among different variables.

### 5. Feature Engineering
New features are created to enhance the predictive power of the machine learning models. This involves transforming existing features or creating new ones based on domain knowledge.

### 6. Modeling
Machine learning models are applied to the dataset to make predictions. This includes splitting the data into training and testing sets, selecting appropriate algorithms, and training the models.

### 7. Evaluation
The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using appropriate metrics. This step ensures that the models are reliable and effective in making predictions.

### 8. Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and insights derived from the analysis. This section highlights the main takeaways and potential implications of the results.

## Results
The results of the analysis include key insights, visualizations, and the performance metrics of the machine learning models. These results demonstrate the ability to analyze data effectively and make accurate predictions.

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of data analytics and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. It showcases the entire process from data cleaning and EDA to modeling and evaluation, providing valuable insights and practical skills.
